**AI VIRTUAL MOUSE**


This projects promotes an approach for the human computer interaction(HCL). Where we use
real time camera for controlling the mouse function.Our proposed project is on hand gesturebased
system that allows users to control desktop mouse movements using hand gesture.To
detect hand gesture movements, our system makes use of a desktop webcam. The goal is to
control mouse cursor functions with a simple camera or webcam rather than a traditional or
standard devices. Using only a camera, the Virtual Mouse provides an infrastructure
between the user and the machine. It enables the user to interact with a machine without the
need for any mechanical or physical devices, and even allows to control mouse
functions.The domain of the project is AI/ML.The programming language we used in this
projects is python.This ai virtual mouse project is based on the concept of computer vision.

2. COMPONENTS
The components used in this venture cannot be detailed, as this assignment is an example for all
computer systems. So, for positive The requirements are as follows:
Hardware requirement:

1. Webcam
To get an image, a webcam is required. Mouse sensitivity is constant with digicam clarity. The excellent
consumer information is demonstrated whilst the digicam configuration is high enough. The camera is
used for real-time images at any time the pc is on. The system will pick out the suitable movement
primarily based on the contact and finger movement.
Software Requirement

1. OpenCV
OpenCV is a massive open-source library of computer imagination and prescient, machine mastering,
and picture processing and now performs a primary function. in real- time performance is the maximum
important in current systems. with the aid of the usage of it, one could system images and motion
pictures to peer matters, face, or even human handwriting.

3. METHODOLOGY
Within the methodology, the technique utilized in every issue of the system might be defined one at a
time. They are the following subsections:

A. Camera Used in the Virtual Gesture Mouse project
Open-CV is python vision library that contains Associate in the organized AI virtual mouse system depends
upon the edges that are gotten by the camera in Associate in nursing passing PC. Pictures can be conveyed in

concealing layered with 3 channels , Grayscale with pixel values fluctuating from 0 (dull) to 255 (white), and
twofold portraying dim or white characteristics (0 or 1) specifically.

B. Moving Hand through the Window using Rectangular Area
The AI virtual mouse framework utilizes the instructive algorithmic rule, and it changes over the co-ordinates of
tip from the camera screen to the pc window full screen for the mouse. Whenever the hands unit saw and
keeping in mind that we've missing to see that finger is up for topic the specific mouse perform, Associate in
Nursing rectangular box is attracted concerning the pc window at ranges the camera locale any spot we've a
penchant to will every now and again move all through the window plan the mouse pointer, as displayed fig.


C. For the Mouse to Perform Left Button Click. If both the index finger with tip Id = 1 and the thumb finger
with tip Id= 0 are up and the distance between the two fingers is lesser than 30px and like both the tips gets
attached, the computer is made to perform the left mouse butto


D. For the Mouse to Perform Double Click
If the index finger with tip Id =1 and the middle finger with tip Id = 2 are up and the distance between
the two fingers is lesser than 40px , and other finger are also in upward direction but the distance
between them is greater than 40px, the computer is made to perform the double click.

E. For the Mouse to Perform Right Button Click
If the index finger with tip Id =1 and the thumb finger with tip Id = 0 are up and the distance between
the two fingers is greater than 40px ,rest of the finger are in downward direction, the computer is made
to perform the right mouse button click.

F. For the Mouse to Perform Scroll up Function
If both the index finger with tip Id =1 and the middle finger with tip Id = 2 are up and the distance
between the two fingers is lesser than 40 px and if the two fingers are moved up the page, the computer
is made to perform the scroll up mouse function.

G. For the Mouse to Perform Scroll down Function
If both the index finger with tip Id = 1 and the middle finger with tip Id = 2 are down and the distance
between the two fingers is lesser than 40px, the two fingers are moved down the page,the computer is
made to perform the scroll down mouse function.


5. APPLICATIONS
The AI virtual mouse system is useful for many applications; it can be used to reduce the space for
using the physical mouse, and it can be used in situations where we cannot use the physical mouse. The
system eliminates the usage of devices, and it improves the human-computer interaction. Major
applications:

(i) The proposed model has a greater accuracy of 99% which is far greater than the that of
other proposed models for virtual mouse, and it has many applications.
(ii) Amidst the COVID-19 situation, it is not safe to use the devices by touching them
because it may result in a possible situation of spread of the virus by touching the devices,
so the proposed AI virtual mouse can be used to control the PC mouse functions without
using the physical mouse.
(iii) Persons with problems in their hands can use this system to control the mouse functions in
the computer.
